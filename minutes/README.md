## Overview  

This folder contains the meeting minutes from the Biology Postdoc Cohort at Emory.    

The group hosts regular meetups to learn about what the postdocs in Biology at Emory are doing, harness cool research skills and tools that everyone uses, foster research overlaps, brainstorm and troubleshoot ideas, discuss weird results that nobody knows the answer to, practise upcoming seminars, and simply build a stronger postdoc culture in Biology at Emory.
