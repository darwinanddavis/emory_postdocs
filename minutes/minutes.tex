\subsection{Overview}\label{overview}

This document contains the meeting minutes from the Biology Postdoc
Cohort at Emory.

The group hosts regular meetups to learn about what the postdocs in
Biology at Emory are doing, harness cool research skills and tools that
everyone uses, foster research overlaps, brainstorm and troubleshoot
ideas, discuss weird results that nobody knows the answer to, practise
upcoming seminars, and simply build a stronger postdoc culture in
Biology at Emory.

Questions and suggestions welcome at
\href{mailto:matthew.malishev@emory.edu}{\nolinkurl{matthew.malishev@emory.edu}}.

\subsection{February 8, 2019}\label{february-8-2019}

In this meeting we created our own research impact statements to
practice distilling our specialised research areas into lay terms.

The general recipe to follow:\\
- What you did\\
- Who was helped\\
- In what way are they better off\\
(different people have different perspectives on importance of the order
of these points)

\textbf{Molly Gallagher}\\
Our models show that for viral infections, treating patients with
defective viral particles that interfere with normal viral replication
can reduce the severity of symptoms, and may reduce the chance of
transmitting the infection to others.

\textbf{Matt Malishev}\\
I'm interested in how diseases spread in nature. I investigate how
environmental change influences energetics of parasite populations
transmitting schistosomiasis. I apply metabolic theory to simulate human
infection probability and exposure risk in space and time to inform
useful biocontrol strategies.

\textbf{Rohan Mehta}\\
I develop new theoretical tools to help biologists study how the
distribution and movement of populations affects their ability to adapt
to environments that vary in space.

\textbf{Lewis Bartlett}\\
I study how different beekeeping practices affect the ways bee diseases
spread and how deadly they become. I use laboratory studies, field
tests, computer simulations, and maths to predict and test which actions
beekeepers should take to prevent infectious diseases.

\textbf{Scott Villa}\\
My research focuses on understanding how and why there are so many
different species. I am interested in how natural selection influences
traits critical for mating. Specifically, I experimentally evolve
parasites on new hosts to explore how new species form under varying
environmental, genetic, and demographic scenarios.

\textbf{Laramie Lemon}\\
I use yeast to investigate how genes are activated. I focus on how the
physical structure of DNA affects the ways it's read, copied, and
translated to produce proteins by different mechanisms.

Some resources on science communication.
